# rankYourWrapped (Working Title)

## Description

A web application that allows Spotify users to view their top artists or tracks over differing time spans (4 weeks, 6 months, all time). Also provides popularity ratings for tracks and artists. Current end goal is to provide users with some sort of idea of how rare their music taste is. Currently running on development Spotify mode ( anyone looking to use this app must be whitelisted manually by Cameron O'Brien). Currently working on getting quota extension through Spotify.


## Tech Stack

Built with React and Django with usage of Spotify's API using Axios. As of 01/03/2023 Django implementation is unrelated to react application functionality. Django implementation implemented for future use for creating a leaderboard of users' popularity rating.
